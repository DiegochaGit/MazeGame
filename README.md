Maze Game.  Read the readme file (Readme.md) for the rules.

Here are the description of the Maze game:

At the beginning of the game, the user provides two integers: n and m. 
The maze for this game is of size n x n and contains m randomly generated obstacles. 
The maze is made up of empty cells, obstacles marked with '▓', and boundaries marked with '░'. 
The player is allowed to move right, down, or left based on a priority system: first right, then down, 
and finally left. 
The player cannot move in the opposite direction of their previous movement, move through obstacles, 
or go beyond the maze boundaries. 
The player enters the maze from the starting position at the top-left corner of the maze, and must 
navigate through the maze to reach the exit at the bottom-right corner of the maze. 
Finally, there is no limit to the number of moves that the player can make in this game.
